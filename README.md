A system set up for flattening speed bumps for ambulances, to reduce patient risk and save time, using computer vision.

# Detection of the ambulance
The ambulance in a particular frame is detected using the yolov5 architecture , a yolo v5 model is trained using Imagenet Object Localized data set , since the data set had high randomness it was not not possible to get high accuraccy as output
